Agenda Items :

- Opening by chair (1 min)
  Introductory meeting with the purpose of getting to know each other and brainstorming plans regarding achieving our
  goals in this project.
- Introduction of members and TA (5 min)
- Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions? (2 min )
  No additions.
- Announcements by the TA (3 min)
- Talking Points : ( Inform / brainstorm / decision making / discuss )
    - < Way of making decisions, voting or consensus > (2 min)
      Consensus is preferred and the most reasonable choice of ours. However, if it does succeed, we will switch to
      voting.
    - < Choosing a leader/mediator for final decisions > (3 min )
      We agreed that Julia Kacprzak will have the final word, as she has the most coding experience out of all of us.
    - < Target grades and ambitions > (5 min )
      Main goal is to pass the course. Our highest ambition is to get a 10, but considering the amount of work in this
      quarter, we will do our best to get an 8. If there is still time left, we will try to raise the grade.
    - < Sub-deadlines for submissions > (3 min )
      Our sub-deadline is Saturday 6 p.m. This way, we can use the time left to focus on possible issues.
    - < Communications means > (2 min )
      The main means of communication are WhatsApp and Mattermost. In case of physical unavailability (e.g. during time
      away from the Netherlands), we will organize meetings on Discord.
    - < Collaboration apart from meetings > (3 min )
      The meetings should be held 3-4 times a week, depending on how long it takes for us to work on an assignment.
    - < Helping eachother and reaching out for help > (2 min )
      Communication is key. Help will be provided from other teammates if necessary.
    - < Ways of determining work quality > (3 min )
      Keep it simple! To be mentioned in the merge requests: how much time does it take to review the code you want to
      merge. Always add comments. Methods should not be too complex to review.
    - < Consequences of broken agreements > (3 min )
      It has to be checked whether effort was put into the late submission or not. If yes, help the person with their
      task. If no and happens twice, talk to the person and report to TA if needed.
    - < Handling disagreements > (2 min )
      Communicate problems and boundaries in order to find a compromise, common ground. The leader will mediate
      conflicts if necessary.
    - < Situations to contact TA/lecturers > (3 min )
        - No effort put into work after warning a teammate
        - Uncomfortable situations among teammates
        - No idea what the solution is regarding a situation / task

- Feedback round : What went well during this meeting and what can be improved next time ? (5 min )
  The organization was good. Teammates have prepared in advanced. For the next time, we should already distribute tasks.
- Planned meeting duration != actual duration ? Where / why did you mis - estimate ? (3 min )
  The planned meeting duration corresponds to the actual duration.
- Question round : Does anyone have anything to add before the meeting closes ? (3 min )
  No added comments.
- Closure (1 min )
