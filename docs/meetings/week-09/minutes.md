Meeting Summary:
- Meeting went well, no problems with the agenda or minutes from last meeting.
- App showcase looked better compared the previous weeks but still had bugs and missing features.
- All tasks from the previous weeks were completed or just about complete.
- TA advised us to try finishing up most things by Friday as gitlab will be very busy during the weekend with the project deadline approaching.
- Discussions on implementation asked what features and rubric items we should aim for, great emphasis was put on going for easy rubric items such as those from Usability/Accesibility or Tasks and Planning.
- The team had a meeting on discord the previous week about things still left to be done and have been working on those.
- Priority goes to features that are part of the backlog and those from rubric items over those such as tests.
- Task distribution:
    - Younes will break down his MR into smaller MRs for Default collection and unique titles.
    - Arina will finish up her implementation of keyboard shortcuts and see if search bar can be debugged.
    - Guy will work on issues assigned to him on gitlab.
    - Gurkaran will work on adding deletion functionality to the note collections.
    - Jamie will finish the rework of the UI that he was working on.
    - Julia will help Younes with the MR of the default collection as it is of extreme high priority.
- Once done with tasks teammates will work to finish all the issues in gitlab and help eachother out in adding the final features.
- Tiny questions about how to interpret rubric items
- Meeting summary by the minute taker
- Feedback round where everyone was happy with how the meeting went and what was discussed.
- Meeting duration turned out to be a little shorter but still long enough.
