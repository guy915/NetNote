# Meeting

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Insuffi- just kidding, Excellent :)

Feedback:

- Very good management of time
- Agenda was well structured and points were mostly covered according to the agenda

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: I'm happy with the notes! I think this structure is easy to read and the notes are comprehensive enough.

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent

- Handled the entire meeting very well.
- Right on time, which was great
- Also did very well at staying on track with the agenda

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Very Good

- I really liked your team vibe, it was what I assume is a very positive working environment, I genuinely enjoyed being
  part of your meeting.
- The only thing i'd point out is that (I'm sorry, i don't know your names :( ) the guys resitting IP were not as
  involved in my opinion. That might also just be due to being tired, though.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

- Features-wise, I'd say you're on the right track.
- The demo was nice, to the point, and I liked that it was on one laptop only.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- I think the work distribution was clear and even enough to me.
- It was also quite clear how you distributed tasks for this week. It's good you kept thinking about how complex a task
  would actually be for everyone.
