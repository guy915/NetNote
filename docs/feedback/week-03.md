# Meeting Week 3 - 27-Nov-2024

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the the points
- the general template is good, but I think that some of the points can be merged (for example the opening and the
  check-in)
- the points were clearly formulated, so everyone had the chance to prepare them

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the notes were properly added to the repo, and the format is good
- excellent notes in terms of clarity and amount. Every important information discussed during the meeting was properly
  noted down.
- there are some concrete agreements, however they are not properly organised (the "Summarize action points : Who ,
  what , when ? (10 min )" point is completely missing in the agenda - even tho the last chair was supposed to include
  it, the minute taker is the right hand and could spotted this ;) ). I would suggest to clearly state in the minutes
  the tasks for everyone in the upcoming week (it's also easier for me to provide constructive feedback based on these)

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- all topics were properly covered
- the times seem appropriate to me, but because this is the last timeslot of the day, the members discussed all the
  items before, so the actual time of the meeting is way shorter. Hopefully the times will improve in the upcoming
  meetings, especially with the demos

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- people were more active this week compared to the last one, which is amazing. However, I still want to see everyone a
  little more implied in the upcoming meetings

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback:

- good start, but not shippable product yet

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- the students discussed (some of) the goals of the last week, but it was hard for me to follow all of them, as they
  were not clearly stated anywhere. There were some issues, but not everyone has assigned issues. I would suggest to
  make a clear overview of the work and post it somewhere (notes can be updated, another document is also fine, issues
  can also work, but everyone needs to have some assigned ones and be sure that you discuss all of them in the upcoming
  meeting)
