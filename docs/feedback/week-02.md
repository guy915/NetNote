# Meeting Week 2 - 20-Nov-2024

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Excellent
Feedback:

- The agenda was there in time, following the template
- The points were clear enough that the team members could prepare them.
- The expected times for each point were a little too long, probably also because you had some time before the meeting
  to discuss them. I'd suggest paying a little more attention to these in the future so the meeting doesn't end too
  quickly.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Insufficient
Feedback:

- Not the case for this week

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good
Feedback:

- The chair ensured that all topics were covered.
- The expected times for each point were too long, so I'd suggest paying a little more attention to these in the future
  so the meeting doesn't end too quickly.

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Sufficient
Feedback:

- The ownership of the meeting was taken by the team, which is a good thing
- Most of the team was active the whole meeting; however, some members were less active (still active, just a little
  quiet in comparison with the other). I’d love to see everyone equally involved in the upcoming meetings
- The atmosphere was constructive
- Everyone listened to all the ideas/comments/questions in the first part of the meeting. However, I noticed a/some
  member(s) looking on their phone(s) in the last part of the meeting. While I understand that the meeting is late
  during the day, I'd like to see everyone focused during the meeting
