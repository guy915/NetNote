# Meeting Week 4 - 04-Dec-2024

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the the points
- the general template is good, but I think that some of the points items need to be more specific. For example, "
  Repository State" might be hard to prepare by the other members

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- notes were merged in time, and were very well organized. The notes were clear and contained concrete agreements, which
  are realistic and actionable. Good job!

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- all the points were reached, but some of the times were not accurate

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the atmosphere is constructive, however, not everyone is contributing equally during the meeting. I would love to see
  a little more involvement from the quiet people in the next meetings

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- there is a working application and progress compared to the last week. An early bug was also discovered during the
  demo, which is a good thing, as the team has now time to fix it
- The team on a good track to create a working application until project end

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the action list of last week was discussed and it seems like everyone worked on diffenet parts of the project.
  However, based on the milestones, it seems like there are parts that were not completed. This is not necessarily an
  issue, but I would suggest to pay a little more attention to the amount of work assigned for each week.
