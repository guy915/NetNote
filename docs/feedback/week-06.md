# Meeting Week 6 - 18-Dec-2024

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- the agenda was there in time, so everyone had time to prepare the the points
- the general template is good, but some of the times should be reduced (the meeting is supposed to be 45 minutes
  instead of 55)
- the points were clearly formulated, so everyone had the chance to prepare them

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- there is a great amount of notes, so good job
- I feel like some parts are missing. For example, in the "Task distribution for the upcoming week." section, there are
  a lot of questions, but not all of them have an answer
- there are no agreements in the minutes, so it is not clear what everyone is supposed to work on

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- the chair ensured that all the points in the agenda are covered for the right amount of time

#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

- team took ownership of the meeting, everyone was involved in the meeting, the atmosphere is constructive, keep it like
  this :D

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- there are not a lot of new changes to the app (mainly because of the midterms week), but the new changes are properly
  implemented
- all the presented changes were merged to main, which is very good
- the team is on a good track to create a working application with extended functionality
